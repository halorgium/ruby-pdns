Ruby PDNS Pipe Backend

This is a framework for hosting specific records using Power DNS, you can code the logic
for these records in ruby, the framework takes care of the hard work like hosting your
code and speaking to PDNS.

A sample record code would be, this is all you would need to do to host foo.your.net in
PDNS and do GeoIP look ups and respond correctly

module Pdns
   newrecord("foo.your.net", :type => :record) do |query, answer|
       answer.qtype :A
       answer.ttl 600
   
       case country(query[:remoteip])
           when "DE"
               answer.content "1.2.3.4"
           else
               answer.content "4.3.2.1"
               answer.content "1.2.3.4"
               answer.content [:TXT, "Some TXT record for this response"]
       end
   end
end
